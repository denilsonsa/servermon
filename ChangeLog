	* === Released 1.4 ===
	* ChangeLog: Manually wrote this file. Don't ask me about what has changed
	in older versions, I don't remember. ;)
	* check_servers.sh(check_http): Updated the wget SINGLE_LINE_OUTPUT
	filter. The old filter was somewhat broken in new wget versions.
	* check_servers.sh: Using LC_ALL=C inside this script. No, I don't plan to
	add support to multiple languages.
